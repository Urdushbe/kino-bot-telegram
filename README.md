ðŸ›  Telegram Kino Bot â€“ Automated Movie Delivery
This bot was designed to seamlessly deliver movies to users through Telegram, using a unique movie code system. It was built to integrate with Instagram reels marketing, where movie previews are shared, and users can obtain the full movie by entering a code into the bot.

ðŸ’¡ How It Works
ðŸ“Œ Step 1: A movie reel is posted on Instagram, featuring a unique movie code on the reel overlay.
ðŸ“Œ Step 2: The user sends the movie code to the Telegram bot.
ðŸ“Œ Step 3: The bot finds the corresponding movie and forwards it from a private Telegram channel to the user.
ðŸ“Œ Step 4: If a movie file is larger than 50MB (Telegram's limit for direct sending), the bot instead forwards it from the private channel, ensuring smooth delivery.
